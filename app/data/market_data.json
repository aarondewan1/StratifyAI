        "summary": "The year kicked off with a surprisingly optimistic tone in financial markets. Investor sentiment was buoyed by signs of moderating inflation, leading to hopes that the Federal Reserve might soften its aggressive interest rate hiking cycle. Technology and growth stocks, which had been battered in 2022, saw a significant rebound. Economic data presented a mixed but generally positive picture, with a resiliently strong labor market and better-than-expected GDP figures suggesting the economy could be heading for a 'soft landing' rather than a deep recession. This positive sentiment overshadowed concerns about a potential slowdown in corporate earnings.",

        "summary": "The optimism of January faded in February as persistent inflation data and hawkish commentary from Federal Reserve officials dampened hopes of an imminent pause in rate hikes. Stronger-than-expected economic reports, including retail sales and labor market data, were interpreted as giving the Fed more room to continue its tightening policy. This led to a sell-off in both equities and bonds, as investors priced in a higher peak for interest rates. Concerns about the impact of sustained high rates on corporate earnings and economic growth returned to the forefront.",

        "summary": "March was a month of significant turmoil and volatility, dominated by the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and subsequent fears of a broader banking crisis. This event triggered a flight to safety, with investors piling into government bonds, causing a sharp drop in yields. While the S&P 500 initially sold off on fears of financial contagion, it later recovered as authorities stepped in to backstop the banking system. Despite the banking stress, the Federal Reserve proceeded with another quarter-point interest rate hike, signaling its continued focus on taming inflation. The market narrative became a tug-of-war between inflation concerns and the potential for a credit crunch to slow the economy.",
